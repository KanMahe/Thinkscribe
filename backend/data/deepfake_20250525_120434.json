        "abstract": "The rapid advancement of deep learning and gen-\nerative artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the proliferation of\ndeepfake and AI-generated images, posing significant challenges\nto digital media integrity, security, and trust. These technologies,\nwhile beneficial in creative and entertainment domains, have\nalso been exploited for malicious purposes, including misinfor-\nmation, identity theft, and fraud. To address these concerns,\nthis research proposes a robust and scalable Deepfake and\nAI-Generated Image Detection System. Leveraging state-of-the-\nart machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs), generative adversarial network (GAN) dis-\ncriminators, and transformer-based architectures, the system is\ndesigned to identify subtle artifacts and inconsistencies inherent\nin synthetic media. The proposed framework incorporates multi-\nmodal analysis, combining visual, spatial, and frequency-domain\nfeatures to enhance detection accuracy. Additionally, the system\nis trained on a diverse and comprehensive dataset comprising\nboth publicly available and custom-generated deepfake and\nAI-generated images to ensure generalizability across various\nmanipulation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate the\nsystem\u2019s effectiveness in achieving high precision and recall rates,\noutperforming existing detection methods. This research con-\ntributes to the ongoing efforts to combat digital misinformation\nand uphold the authenticity of visual media in the age of AI.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the proliferation of deep learning (DL) techniques has given rise to a significant challenge in the form of deepfake videos, posing a grave threat to the authenticity of media content. With the rapid advancement of DL technology, the creation of convincingly realistic deepfake videos has become increasingly prevalent, raising serious concerns about the potential misuse of such content. Deepfakes have the potential to undermine trust in visual media, with implications for fields as diverse as journalism, entertainment, and security. This study presents an innovative solution by harnessing blockchain-based federated learning (FL) to address this issue, focusing on preserving data source anonymity. The approach combines the strengths of SegCaps and convolutional neural network (CNN) methods for improved image feature extraction, followed by capsule network (CN) training to enhance generalization. A novel data normalization technique is introduced to tackle data heterogeneity stemming from diverse global data sources. Moreover, transfer learning (TL) and preprocessing methods are deployed to elevate DL performance. These efforts culminate in collaborative global model training zfacilitated by blockchain and FL while maintaining the utmost confidentiality of data sources. The effectiveness of our methodology is rigorously tested and validated through extensive experiments. These experiments reveal a substantial improvement in accuracy, with an impressive average increase of 6.6% compared to six benchmark models. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates a 5.1% enhancement in the area under the curve (AUC) metric, underscoring its ability to outperform existing detection methods. These results substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed solution in countering the proliferation of deepfake content. In conclusion, our innovative approach represents a promising avenue for advancing deepfake detection. By leveraging existing data resources and the power of FL and blockchain technology, we address a critical need for media authenticity and security. As the threat of deepfake videos continues to grow, our comprehensive solution provides an effective means to protect the integrity and trustworthiness of visual media, with far-reaching implications for both industry and society. This work stands as a significant step toward countering the deepfake menace and preserving the authenticity of visual content in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.",
